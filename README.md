# GettingAndCleaningData_Assignment
This repository contains the R script, the tidy dataset and the code book describing the variables and procedures in manipulating the raw data.

Contents of this repository:

1) TidyData.csv
These are the results of the processing on the raw data computed by "run_analysis.R" 

2) run_analysis.R
This is a R script which loads the raw "wearable computing" data and completes a series of tidying up functions
                  
2) CodeBook.md
The codebook describes each "tidy variable" in the "TidyData.csv". The codebook also describes the processing procedure.
